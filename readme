simple_species class
********************

MMM20121026

This class provides a nice plasma fluid species object (can be ions or electrons). It basically has a mass, a charge, and defines the thermodynamics of the species.

There are three thermodynamic models defined so far 20121026:
cold
isothermal
adiabatic

Set thermo_model to one of these strings.

thermo_model_data contains the necessary parameters for each model. You can set them freely.

Functions h and T provide the barotropy and temperature of the species given n.

Several checks to the input are carried out by the class. They should be fine.

TEST_simple_species has the tests that the class has to pass to conform to its own definition. In fact, the tests are the "requirements" themselves.
